## Folder content
In this folder there are the following files:
- wine_data.zip is an archive containing two .csv files, which are the two datasets I used for the EDA;
- best_wine_EDA.ipynb is the file containing the EDA;
- portugal_wineries.html is an HTML page created automatically during the EDA due to the creation of a map;
- winemap-data-130k-v2.csv **-please ignore this file-** after I pushed it, I had the warning message that it was too big, and I didn't understand yet how to delete it. Hence, the .zip archive.

## Dataset
The dataset used comes from one of the suggested datasets for this exam: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zynicide/wine-reviews.
